Important note
--------------

If you are experiencing issues with installing the software, you may wish to explore Google Colaboratory.

https://colab.research.google.com/

Colab is very similar to Jupyter in that it allows you can run Python code in your web browser. The biggest difference is that the code you run is not executed locally (i.e., on your machine), but on a graphics processing unit (GPU) in some far-off data centre, probably on the other side of the Atlantic. 

You can open the .ipynb (Python Notebook) files with colab.
