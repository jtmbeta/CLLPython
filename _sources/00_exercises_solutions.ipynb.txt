    "This week there is some recommended reading and practical work that builds on what we covered in the first session. \n",
    "\n",
    "The article I would like you to read, and you can access it by clicking on the blue link, is called *[How long does it take to learn Python?](https://realpython.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-python/)* This is an accessible read that explores reasons for learning Python, what it means to learn Python, how you can keep track of progress, factors that may influence your journey, how long it takes, and resources that may help speed your learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of your efforts this week should be directed towards familiarising yourself with Jupyter and Spyder. Both of these software have a `Help` menu, which is a great place to begin. You are bound to encounter technical jargon and concepts that you don't understand, but don't worry! Just make a note, and remember to ask me about it when you get the chance.\n",

    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have another look at the number guessing game script. With an instruction like **\"Enter any number: \"**, a naive user could be forgiven for entering something like 78.3, which is, after all, a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if a decimal number is entered, the program throws a cryptic error message. See for yourself by clicking on the cell below, pressing `Shift+Enter` to execute the code, and then entering a decimal number instead of a whole number. Don't worry about the error message for now. Suffice to say that the computer is unable to carry out the instruction!\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be better if the user knew not to enter a decimal number. **Change the code below so that when it is executed the instruction will read \"Enter a whole number between 0 and 100: \"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint** - look at the first `input` function\n",
    "\n",
    "If you found that easy, try changing the message at the end of the program to make it more congratulatory!\n"
