    "# Week 0 - Introduction to the Python programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you are going to install Anaconda, learn the basics of Jupyter and Spyder, and write your first Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a free and open-source data science platform for Python. It serves as a hub for the Python programming language and provides convenient tools for managing all of the different versions of Python and its many packages. Anaconda does a lot of behind-the-scenes work to ensure that packages do not conflict with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "To **install Anaconda**, [follow this link](https://www.anaconda.com/) and select the correct download for your platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully installing the software, **start the Anaconda Navigator App**, which should now appear in your Start Menu (Windows) or Application Folder (Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, use the Navigator App to **create a Python environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Select the `Environments` tab\n",
    "  2. Click the `+` box at the bottom that says `Create`\n",
    "  3. Give your environment a sensible name, e.g., *Py3* or *python3*\n",
    "  4. Check that you are installing the latest version of Python\n",
    "  5. Click the `Create` button to create the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/anaconda_navigator_create_environment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click `Create`, the software will get to work setting up your Python environment. When it has finished, **click on the newly created environment to make sure that it is activated**. \n",
    "\n",
    "***N.B.*** **A Python environment is a way of isolating the functionality needed for a specific project.** If you were a crafty person who had various knitting and cross-stitching projects on the go, it would make sense to keep your knitting and cross-stitching materials in separate boxes so you can quickly grab the right box for the project that you want to work on. Its the same principal with Python environments. If you want to learn more about Python environments with conda, [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-conda-environments-bc6180fc533) goes into a lot of detail, but all you really need to know at the moment is that you have successfully made one, and that **you should remember to activate it each time you open the Anaconda Navigator!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Welcome to [Jupyter!](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is **a web-based interactive development environment** that has become extremely popular in recent years. It is a great tool for beginners as it allows you to experiment freely with code snippets and to present or share your work in accessible and appealing formats. We will use Jupyter for much of this course, and the document you are currently reading was in fact prepared in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "To **install Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Click on the `Home` tab in Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "  2. Check that your newly created Python environment is active\n",
    "  3. Find the Jupyter Notebook app and click `install`\n",
    "  4. After installing, click `Launch`\n",
    "  \n",
    "![](../images/anaconda_navigator_install_jupyter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After launching Jupyter, you should see a new tab open in your web browser.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Click on the tab and use the file browser to navigate to the folder where you are keeping the documents for this course.\n",
    "  2. Find and open the document titled `00_introduction_to_the_python_programming_language.ipynb` (that's this document!)\n",
    "  3. It should open in a new tab. Scroll down to this part of the document.\n",
    "\n",

    "**N.B.** The file extension for Jupyter Notebooks is `.ipynb`, which stands for \"IPython Notebook\". That's because Jupyter notebooks \n",
